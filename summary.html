          <h3>Overall Findings</h3>
          <p style="font-size: 1.25rem;">
            From our visual exploration of crime data in Boston, we observed clear seasonal fluctuations, with incidents tending to peak during the summer months and drop off in winter. Certain offenses, such as vandalism, theft, and assault, consistently appeared among the top reported
            crimes year after year, suggesting specific areas where increased attention and resources might have a strong impact. Zooming in on the 2019–2023 window revealed that broader societal events, like the COVID-19 pandemic, could temporarily suppress crime rates, though incident counts gradually rebounded afterward. We also found that while lower-income districts typically experienced higher crime, some neighborhoods defied this pattern, implying that additional factors, such as local community initiatives or proximity to nightlife hubs, play a role in shaping outcomes. Going forward, we can enhance our insights by integrating other data points, like weather conditions, major public events, and more granular socioeconomic metrics, to pinpoint why certain neighborhoods see sudden spikes. Finally, applying predictive modeling techniques would allow policymakers and community organizations to forecast potential hotspots and craft more targeted, proactive interventions that address Boston’s evolving public safety needs.        </div>
